Structure: Add manifest.json, icons, and basic folder layout (background, popup, content, options, shared).

Tooling: Configure ESLint, Prettier, Vitest/Jest, sinon-chrome.

Automation: Add npm scripts for dev, build, test, e2e, and packaging (zip).

Docs: Update README with build/run instructions.

âœ… Deliverable: A fully bootstrapped extension project that builds and runs in Chrome with a clear developer workflow.



ðŸ“„ M2 â€“ Core Capture & Popup

Goal: Enable basic data capture and display in the popup.

Selection Capture: Grab highlighted text from the page.

Tab Metadata: Collect current tab URL and title.

Popup UI: Vue-based popup displaying captured text/URL with send actions.

Transports:

Native messaging client (with retries/failover).

Reconnectable WebSocket client with backoff.

HTTP fallback to FastAPI backend.

Options Page: UI for configuring transports and testing connections.

Integration Tests: Verify end-to-end routing and error handling with mocks.

âœ… Deliverable: Extension can send data to backend using native, WebSocket, or HTTP, configurable via options.

Goal: Guarantee quality through high coverage and CI automation.

Coverage: Expand tests to achieve â‰¥85% unit/integration coverage.

E2E Tests: Playwright/Puppeteer + web-ext simulate selectionâ†’send flow.

CI Job: Run build, tests, and artifact upload in CI.

âœ… Deliverable: Extension with automated tests and CI ensuring quality on every PR.



ðŸ“¦ M6 â€“ Production & Release Readiness

Goal: Finalize for Chrome Web Store submission.

Build Optimization: Tree-shaking, minification, sourcemaps.

CSP: Configure connect-src for dev/prod endpoints.

Assets: Final icons and packaged ZIP passing Web Store checks.
