# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Clipboard Sync project is a cross-platform system that enables users to capture text selections and URLs from Chrome browser and synchronize them across a desktop application. The system demonstrates integration between a Chrome Extension, Electron desktop app, Python backend API, and PostgreSQL database. Users can highlight text or capture URLs in Chrome, send them to a desktop application for storage and viewing, creating a seamless clipboard synchronization experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Chrome browser user, I want to capture selected text from web pages and send it to my desktop application, so that I can access my clipboard history outside the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects text on any web page THEN the Chrome extension SHALL detect the selected text
2. WHEN a user clicks the extension popup THEN the system SHALL display the currently selected text
3. WHEN a user clicks "Send" in the extension popup THEN the system SHALL transmit the selected text to the Electron desktop application
4. IF no text is selected THEN the extension SHALL display an appropriate message indicating no selection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Chrome browser user, I want to capture the current page URL and send it to my desktop application, so that I can save important web page references for later access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the extension popup THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the current active tab URL
2. WHEN a user clicks "Send URL" in the extension popup THEN the system SHALL transmit the current page URL to the Electron desktop application
3. WHEN sending a URL THEN the system SHALL include both the URL and page title for context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a desktop user, I want to view my recent clipboard entries in a dedicated application, so that I can easily access and manage my synchronized clipboard history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Electron app receives clipboard data from the Chrome extension THEN it SHALL store the data via the backend API
2. WHEN the Electron app starts THEN it SHALL display the last 5 clipboard entries in the main window
3. WHEN new clipboard data is received THEN the Electron app SHALL refresh the display to show the updated list
4. WHEN displaying clipboard entries THEN the system SHALL show the content, type (text/URL), and timestamp for each entry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all clipboard data to be persistently stored in a database, so that clipboard history is maintained across application restarts and system reboots.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend receives a POST request to /clip THEN it SHALL validate the input data using Pydantic models
2. WHEN valid clipboard data is received THEN the backend SHALL store it in PostgreSQL with a timestamp
3. WHEN the backend receives a GET request to /clips THEN it SHALL return the latest 10 entries ordered by creation time
4. WHEN storing clipboard entries THEN the system SHALL assign a unique ID and creation timestamp to each entry

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be containerized and testable, so that it can be easily deployed and maintained across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the backend THEN it SHALL run in a Docker container with all dependencies
2. WHEN deploying the database THEN it SHALL run in a separate PostgreSQL Docker container
3. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL execute Pytest unit tests for all API endpoints
4. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN Docker Compose SHALL orchestrate both backend and database containers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my clipboard data to be validated and handled securely, so that the system protects against malicious input and data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend receives any input THEN it SHALL validate all data using appropriate validation rules
2. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages with HTTP status codes
3. WHEN accessing the database THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
4. WHEN running in Docker THEN the database SHALL be accessible only within the Docker network

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear communication protocols between components, so that the system maintains reliable data flow and error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Chrome extension communicates with Electron THEN it SHALL use native messaging or WebSocket protocols
2. WHEN the Electron app communicates with the backend THEN it SHALL use HTTP REST API calls
3. WHEN any component encounters an error THEN it SHALL log the error and provide user-friendly feedback
4. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the Electron app SHALL display an appropriate connection error message
